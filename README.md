# portage
Gentoo Portage overlay containing various out-of-tree patches and ebuilds which usually require improvement before eventual inclusion in main portage tree.

In order to use these ebuilds and patches, you will need to manually `ebuild /path/to/file.ebuild digest` after inclusion in your local portage overlay...
